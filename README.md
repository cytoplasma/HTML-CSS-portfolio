# HTML-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

My primary goals in mind when constructing my portfolio was to learn more in-depth CSS skills, practice formatting optimal code, and strengthening my knowledge in flexbox (as that's my weakpoint with CSS). During development, I learned a lot about media queries and was able to utilize useful CSS techniques like using root variables.
